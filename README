NAME
    App::Git::Sync

SYNOPSIS
        git config --global github.user <youruser>
        git config --global github.token <yourtoken from github.com/account>
        git-sync --gitdir /home/t0m/code/git

DESCRIPTION
    "git-sync" is a simple script to keep all of your checkouts up to date.

    It will work through every repository which you have in your git dir,
    and if that repository exists on github, then its network will be looked
    up, any remotes which you haven't got added will be added, and all your
    remotes will be fetched.

    Any repositories which you have on github that are not checked out
    locally will be cloned (and then remotes will be added and fetched).

TODO
    Use git config to store git dir
    Factor out github code, so that you can have multiple git services to
    clone all of (e.g. Catgit / Moose git)
    Ability to automatically mirror out into alternate repositories
    Generally make it suck less than a quick hack I wrote on the train.
