NAME
    App::Git::Sync

SYNOPSIS
        git config --global github.user <youruser>
        git config --global github.token <yourtoken from github.com/account>
        git-sync --gitdir /home/t0m/code/git

DESCRIPTION
    "git-sync" is a simple script to keep all of your checkouts up to date.

    When run, it will clone any new github repositories (which are not
    cloned somewhere within "--gitdir", and then will fetch all remotes in
    all cloned repositories (except repositories which were just cloned for
    the first time.

TODO
    Use git config to store git dir
    Factor out github code, so that you can have multiple git services to
    clone all of (e.g. Catgit / Moose git)
    Explore github network, so you automatically clone forks
    Ability to automatically mirror out into alternate repositories
    Generally make it suck less than a quick hack I wrote on the train.
